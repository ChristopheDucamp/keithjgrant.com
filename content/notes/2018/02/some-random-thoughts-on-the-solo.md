Some random thoughts on the Solo trailer:

A lot of exciting stuff (Donald Glover!), but perhaps the least exciting part is Han Solo himself. He doesn’t _seem_ like the Han Solo we know.

Then again, the Han Solo we know—at the beginning of New Hope—isn’t all that great a guy. If these movies are to have any character development, it will have to be more a character *devolvement*. Han Solo may start out a decent guy, and these films will turn him into the Looking-Out-For-Number-One scoundrel we know.
