Coding from Home on Snowy Morning

Whose code this is I think I know.
Written before Prettier, though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch parenthesis reflow.

My editor must think it queer
To save without a commit near.
My MacBook Pro will keep me warm
The coldest morning of the year.

A yellow line highlights to warn
Of declaration with bad form.
The only other soundâ€™s the beep
From webpack build that did perform.

JS is lovely, dark and deep,
But I have Promises to keep,
And JIRAs to go before I sleep,
And JIRAs to go before I sleep.
