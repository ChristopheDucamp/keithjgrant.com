**Coding from Home on a Snowy Morning**

Whose code this is I think I know.<br>
Written before Prettier, though;<br>
He will not see me stopping here<br>
To watch parenthesis reflow.

My editor must think it queer<br>
To save without a commit near.<br>
My MacBook Pro will keep me warm<br>
The coldest morning of the year.

A yellow line highlights to warn<br>
Of declaration with bad form.<br>
The only other soundâ€™s the beep<br>
From webpack build that did perform.

JS is lovely, dark and deep,<br>
But I have Promises to keep,<br>
And JIRAs to go before I sleep,<br>
And JIRAs to go before I sleep.
