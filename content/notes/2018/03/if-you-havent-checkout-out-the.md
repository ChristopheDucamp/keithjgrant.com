If you haven’t checkout out the “IndieWeb,” you should. I am in fact replying to this tweet using two open web standards backed by W3C specifications:

Micropub, to post to my blog using a 3rd party client (which happens to integrate w/ twitter). And Webmention, to inform a site when I have liked or replied to something on it (which I happen to then propagate back into twitter).
