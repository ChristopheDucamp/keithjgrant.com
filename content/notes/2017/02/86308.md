Google AMP is like nutrition supplements... Michael Pollan says, “Be the kind of person who takes supplements — then skip the supplements,” because supplements have been proven not to help you, but people who take them are healthier.

Maybe Google AMP is like that: Follow the rules of AMP pages, then skip the AMP cache.
