My new site design is live! I’ve been working on this one for a while, and it just so happened to coincide with the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/newwwyear?src=hash">#newwwyear</a> activity on Twitter. I’m calling this theme *Shindig*.

Have a look around. I’ve got some new fonts and colors that I hope I can stick with for a while, even across projects and into new redesigns. I’ve added full page transitions everywhere. (Try it! They’re fun!) And, of course, I still support <a href="https://webmention.net/">Webmention</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">Micropub</a>, because I’m still loving the <a href="https://www.recallact.com/presentation/decentralized-social-web">IndieWeb</a>.
