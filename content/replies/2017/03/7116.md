You have a few options, but none are perfect. Honestly, this is what grid is for (though, in this instance, a sub-grid would be ideal, but that isn&#39;t implemented yet).

A couple possibilities w/ the current setup:

1. set a min-height on the title, equal to either 2 or 3 lines of text. Downside: would produces a gap below the titles when none of them wrap; it also will still fall out of alignment if you wrap more times than that.
2. put a margin-top: auto on the description. This will push it down to the bottom of its flex container. But this will knock it out of alignment w/ the &quot;special&quot; item... so you would have to put a dummy (invisible) placeholder there for items without a &quot;special.&quot;
