A decentralized social network called The Internet. Where you can reply to anything, like anything, and re-post anything. :) It’s an open standard backed by the W3C.

For example, I’m not replying to your tweet on Twitter… I’m replying on my blog (and then syndicating that to Twitter). I own my data.

Some blogs like [Known](https://withknown.com/) and the upcoming [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) support it. Or you can use some Wordpress plugins to partially support it. Check out http://indieweb.org/ for more info.
