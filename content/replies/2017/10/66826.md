I’m a strong fan of normalizing. Resets tend to undo a lot of stuff I would rather have in place. And normalize.css has historically fixed a lot of odd browser quirks that resets may or may not address.

I’m also wary of over-reacting to this one change by Chrome. Yeah, it may result in some odd bugs, but I don’t want to become heavy-handed in defending against it in the future, as it’s an extremely rare circumstance.
