Re “That’s not how the Force works”:

I think that’s a big point this film is trying to make: the Force is bigger than we’ve previously believed. It’s not just about moving rocks. It can connect two minds from light years apart. It can be used to project an image of yourself across the galaxy. A force ghost can summon lightning.

If it can do all that, I have no qualms accepting Leia can do what she did.
