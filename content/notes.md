# Olive branch

* abstract nature of CSS - doing it in JS removes unknowns
* ...but also removes things CSS does for you for free
* “CSS is for documents, not web apps”


common arguments:
* just learn CSS
* documents vs apps
*


Here are things that each fit in a tweet, but they don’t all fit in a tweet together. They are all true (IMO). They are all relevant, to varying degrees, but maybe we need to do a better job of not conflating them all together:

* Web developers should take the time to learn CSS and learn it well
* CSS can be a compile target
* It depends! What’s right for one project isn’t automatically right for all projects.
