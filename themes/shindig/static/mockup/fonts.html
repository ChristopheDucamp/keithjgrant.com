      <h1>Don't QWOP Your Way Through CSS</h1>
      <p><a href="http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">QWOP</a>, if you haven’t played it, is a ridiculous running game. Instead of pressing, say, the right arrow key to run, you must control each of the runner’s muscles independently. Pressing the keys Q, W, O, and P will each extend one leg or bend one knee. Coordinating them all is incredibly difficult, and you are usually lucky if you can make a full stride before falling on your head.</p>

      <h2>Think in systems</h2>
      <p>This is also how a lot of developers treat CSS. Instead of thinking about constructing a robust system, they focus on only one specific part of the desired result. Instead of asking, “How do I run?”, they ask, “How do I flex my knee?” I can teach you how to flex your knee, but if QWOP shows us anything, that knowledge might actually make running more difficult.</p>

      <p>CSS does a lot of work for you, if you will let it. Normal document flow ensures things all fit together on the page; this is why you should be judicious with positioning that breaks out of document flow. CSS automatically sizes your elements to contain their text; this is why you should avoid explicitly setting height. Relative units allow you to define one value in terms of another so they will respond together if the context changes; this is why I sometimes frown on pixel units. Margins collapse so that paragraphs stack with the correct spacing. Certain properties inherit down the DOM tree so you don’t have to specify a font for every single element.</p>
